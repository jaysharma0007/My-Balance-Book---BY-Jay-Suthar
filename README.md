## How to Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. **Upload files**: Ensure all files and folders (`css`, `js`, etc.) are uploaded to your GitHub repository.
2. **Settings**: Go to your Repository Settings > Pages.
3. **Source**: Select "Deploy from a branch" and choose `main` (or `master`) branch.
4. **Save**: Click Save.
5. **Visit**: Wait a few moments, then visit the provided URL (e.g., `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo/`).

## Note on Paths
The project has been optimized for GitHub Pages by using relative paths (`./`) instead of absolute paths (`/`). This ensures it works correctly even when hosted in a subdirectory.
